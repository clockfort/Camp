This is the camp source repo. These four subdirectories contain the
packages that make up camp:

* camp-core         The central patch modules
* camp-network      The CURL binding
* camp-repository   Repositories of patches
* camp-bin          The actual camp executable

This contains the testsuite:

* tests

And finally, the camp-view tool prototype is here:

* camp-view
